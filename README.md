# skeleton_riverpod

This project combines the Flutter 2.5 skeleton project with the [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev) state management library, providing a more elegant, modular, real-world template for starting your new app.

To generate the starting project, the following command was run:
```
flutter create -t skeleton skeleton_riverpod
```
For context, [riverpod package](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod) is a more recent rewrite by the same author of the [provider package](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) discussed in the
[simple app state management
tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple) article.

## Localization

This project generates localized messages based on arb files found in
the `lib/src/localization` directory.
